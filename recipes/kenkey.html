    <h2> <strong>Steps in Preparing Kenkey</strong></h2>

    <p> The dish is produced by soaking grains of maize in water for approximately a week. They are later milled and kneaded with water into a dough. The dough is then set aside to ferment for about four days to a week.</p>
    <p>Kenkey is considered to be similar to sourdough dumplings and is generally accompanied by pepper crudaiola and fried fish, soup or stew.</p>   


    <h2><strong>Ingredients</strong></h2>
        <ul>
            <li>White cornmeal - 3 cups</li>
            <li>Corn starch - 1 tbsp</li>
            <li>Warm water - 3 cups</li>
            <li>Salt - 1 tsp</li>
            <li>Dried corn leaves</li>

        </ul>
    
    <h2><strong>Steps</strong></h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Begin by taking a large bowl and adding the cornmeal and the corn starch to it.</li>
            <li>Now, pour in warm water and stir constantly until you attain a smooth dough.</li>
            <li>Once done, cover the bowl with a clean cloth and keep it aside in a warm place for about 2- 4 days.</li>
            <li>After 4 days, take the prepared dough and divide it in half.</li>
            <li>Now take a large pot and add 2 cups of water to it. Bring it to a boil, add salt, and lower the flame to medium.</li>
            <li>Next, transfer half of the dough to the water and combine properly.</li>
            <li>Allow it to cook for about 10 minutes and make sure to stir constantly.</li>
            <li>Take the pot off the heat and mix in the remaining dough, combining well.</li>
            <li>Now, take the dough and separate it into 3 or 4 large portions. Shape them into balls and set every prepared ball on a corn leaf.</li>
            <li>It is time to cover each ball by wrapping the corn leaf around them and tying them up with a string.</li>
            <li>The next step is to steam the prepared corn leaf balls. For that, take a steamer and add a large amount of hot water to it.</li>
            <li>Transfer the wrapped kenkey into the steam basket and allow the water to boil. Make sure to keep the heat high.</li>
            <li>Once the water comes to a boil, lower the heat and, over low heat, steam the kenkey for approximately 1 hour and 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Once done, take them out carefully and serve them along with shito, diced or ground red and/or green pepper and fish.</li>
        </ol>
