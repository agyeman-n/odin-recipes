    <h2> <strong>Steps in Preparing Fufu</strong></h2>

    <p> To make fufu without a traditional Ghanaian large wooden mortar and a pestle, simply place cooked cassava and ripe plantain into a food processor and blend into a smooth paste with some water. Transfer the mixture to a pan, continue cooking for 8 to 10 minutes, stirring constantly, until it becomes dense, and then steam for additional 8 to 10 minutes. The achieved texture should be elastic and slightly sticky.</p>
    <p>After cooling, fufu is usually formed into a ball and served with soup, stew or sauce. In Ghana, it is eaten with your right hand. A bite-sized portion is torn, formed into a small ball and then dipped in soup.</p>   

    <h2><strong>Ingredients</strong></h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Un-ripened Plantain</li>
            <li>Cassava</li>

        </ul>
    
    <h2><strong>Steps</strong></h2>
        <ol>
            <li>First, peel the plantain and cut it into cubes. Peel and scrape the cassava, de-string it and also cut into cubes.</li>
            <li>Next, place the cassava and plantain into the blender. Add water: for now, use 350 ml (1 1/2 cups) if you want fufu to be firmer, or 450 ml (2 cups) if you prefer it softer.</li>
            <li>Turn the blender on and process the ingredients into a smooth paste.</li>
            <li>Next, heat the paste in a saucepan over medium heat. Stir constantly with a wooden spatula for 8 to 10 minutes to remove any lumps.</li>
            <li>Now, add the remaining 50 ml (3 tbsp) of water to the mixture. Reduce the heat to the lowest setting, cover with a lid and steam for another 8 to 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>After that, increase the heat to medium setting and stir. The fufu might look too soft, but it will become firmer as it cools down.</li>
            <li>Transfer the fufu into a bowl and sprinkle one teaspoon of water on the surface to prevent forming a film. Let it cool completely.</li>
            <li>Shape fufu into a ball and serve with soup or stew of your choice.</li>
        </ol>
