    <h2> <strong>Steps in Preparing Banku</strong></h2>

    <p> Banku is a traditional Ghanaian dish made from fermented maize and cassava dough. The banku mixture is boiled in water until it has a smooth, white paste-like appearance before being kneaded into a dough. This process is repeated until the dough is evenly cooked.</p>


    <h2><strong>Ingredients</strong></h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Cornmeal - 2 cups</li>
            <li>Cassava dough - 2 cups</li>
            <li> Water - 8 cups</li>   
            <li>Salt - to taste</li>    

        </ul>
    
    <h2><strong>Steps</strong></h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, mix the cornmeal and cassava dough together until well combined.</li>
            <li>Add 2 cups of water to the mixture and stir well.</li>
            <li>Cover the bowl with a clean cloth and let it sit for 2-3 days to ferment. The mixture will become slightly sour and bubbly.</li>
            <li>After fermentation, add 2 cups of water to the mixture and stir well. Use your hands to knead the dough until it becomes smooth and elastic.</li>
            <li>In a large pot, bring 4 cups of water to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium and gradually add the dough to the pot, stirring constantly to prevent lumps from forming.</li>
            <li>Continue stirring the mixture for about 20-30 minutes or until it thickens and becomes smooth and glossy.</li>
            <li>Add salt to taste and stir well.</li>
            <li>Remove the pot from the heat and use a wooden spoon to beat the mixture vigorously until it becomes fluffy and elastic.</li>
            <li>Serve the banku hot with soup, stew, or sauce.</li>
        </ol>
